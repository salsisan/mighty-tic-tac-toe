The players compete over 9 traditional boards of Tic-Tac-Toe, which themselves comprise a bigger game. The rules for winning each of the boards are the same as the traditional game, but the twist is that a player's move in a certain cell dictates the board where the next player has to play, which corresponds to the location of this cell. If the next player is dictated to play in a board that has already been won or is full, the player can instead decide where to play in any of the boards."
