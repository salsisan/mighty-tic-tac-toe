# Mighty Tic Tac Toe

A fun twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game that gets you thinking about best ways to beat your competitor. In order to win the game, you have to win three smaller tic tac toe boards in a row, column, or diagonal. Every move you make forces the other player to play in the board corresponding to the cell you filled. Have fun playing the game with another player on the same device, or try out the single player mode.

The game is live in the Windows 10 app store:
